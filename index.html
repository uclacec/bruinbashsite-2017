                Hello Bruins!
                <br><br>
                UCLA Campus Events Commission and Cultural Affairs Commission are pleased to announce that UCLA's annual Welcome Back Bruin Bash Concert is returning for its 15th year in a row. On Monday, September 25th, all UCLA undergraduate Bruins will have the opportunity to experience a pre-concert festival full of giveaways and other swag, an outdoor film screening, and of course the classic Bruin Bash concert in our very own Pauley Pavilion.
                <br><br>
                Due to the size of the concert venue, we unfortunately cannot guarantee that all current undergraduate students will receive a wristband for the concert. This year, tickets for the concert will be requested online in the following ways:
                <br><br>
                <b>Floor (Ground Level – Standing Only) tickets</b> - Will be available September 13th, 2017 at 10:00am. Floor tickets will be available on this date and time and run on a first come first served basis until no floor tickets remain. Once all floor tickets have been claimed, you will be prompted to explore the opportunity to enter the ticket lottery for 100/200 level (seated) tickets (please see below). If you are granted a floor level ticket, you will not have the opportunity to change into 100/200 level seating.
                <br><br>
                <b>100/200 level (Seated) tickets</b> - Students have the option of entering an online lottery to receive a ticket for 100/200 level concert seating. Note that not all students who enter the lottery will receive a ticket due to venue capacity restraints. Students will be notified September 23rd of the result of the lottery.
                <br><br>
                More details can be found under <a href="#lottery-FAQ" style="color:darkorange">Tickets & FAQ</a>.
                <br><br>
                If interested in signing up for the opportunity to receive a Bruin Bash concert ticket, please be mindful of the Monday, <b>September 18th 4:00pm</b> deadline.
                <br><br>
                Before the lottery opens, we highly suggest that you attempt to login to your <a style="color:darkorange" href="https://oss.ticketmaster.com/aps/uclacto2/EN/account/login" target="_blank">CTO Student account here</a>.
